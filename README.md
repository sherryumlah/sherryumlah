# Hi, I'm Sherry — an outcome-driven product engineering leader who turns ideas into aligned, executable plans

I’m an **Engineering Manager** and **Technical Program Manager** who brings clarity, direction, and psychological safety to complex technical work. Over the last 20+ years, I’ve led teams across SaaS, developer tooling, edtech, and digital product ecosystems — with a leadership style rooted in **people-centric practices, continuous discovery, and outcome-driven alignment**.

Today, I’m looking for **remote Engineering Leader or Technical Program Manager roles** where I can help product engineering teams deliver meaningful, user-centered impact.

---

## What I’m Exceptional At
### **People-Centric Leadership**
I build environments where engineers do the best work of their careers — grounded in trust, autonomy, and thoughtful feedback. I believe *clarity is kindness* and that the best teams are aligned, not micromanaged.

### **Turning Strategy Into Roadmaps**
I connect product vision to engineering execution. Whether it’s developer tools, platform work, or user-facing workflows, I translate ambiguous concepts into actionable plans that stay aligned across stakeholders.

### **Career Coaching & Engineer Development**
One of my greatest strengths (and joys) is helping engineers grow:

- Building individualized development plans tied to strengths, aspirations, and business needs  
- Turning feedback into fuel — not fear  
- Helping engineers move from “task executors” to strategic contributors  
- Coaching on architecture thinking, communication, ownership, and decision-making  
- Supporting people through promotions, role transitions, and cross-functional growth  
- Creating processes and systems that *scale* growth, not just manage it  

I’ve coached multiple engineers, new managers, and product-adjacent roles — through Practica and internally — with a focus on confidence, accountability, and sustainable career movement.

### **Developer Experience & Internal Platforms**
I love making engineers’ lives easier — optimizing pipelines, improving integrations, reducing friction in local dev, and creating the “pit of success” for teams.

### **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
I partner deeply with Product, Design, Infrastructure, and People Ops to ensure we’re building the right thing, at the right depth, in the right order.
