# Hi, I’m Sherry — a Learning Program Leader and Developer who builds engaging, scalable learning systems

I design and deliver **learner-centered, interactive learning experiences** that help people build confidence and understand complex ideas. With 20+ years spanning **e-learning development, instructional design, and SaaS product engineering**, I bring a rare blend of **learning design, technical fluency, and program leadership** to online education and training initiatives.

I’ve led large-scale learning programs, built interactive digital learning products, and partnered deeply with subject-matter experts, designers, engineers, and stakeholders to turn learning goals into **measurable, meaningful outcomes**.

Today, I’m focused on **Learning Experience Design, Learning Program Management, and Online Learning Development**—especially work that blends instructional design with interactivity, thoughtful UX, and modern delivery platforms.
